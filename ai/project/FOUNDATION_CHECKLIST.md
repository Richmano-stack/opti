> **Type: PROJECT-SPECIFIC** | Fill this out during Phase 2. It is the gate document for entering Phase 3.

# Foundation Checklist

This document is the **Phase 2 gate**. The AI agent reads this before touching any feature ticket. If any `required` item is not `done`, it must stop and report what is missing.

**Skills used during Phase 2:** `source-driven-development`, `api-and-interface-design`, `security-and-hardening`

**Phase 2 complete:** `<!-- FILL: yes / not yet -->`

---

## How to Use

For each foundation area below:
1. Set status to `required` or `not needed` based on `ai/project/product/DISCOVERY.md`.
2. If `not needed`, record the reason in `ai/project/memory/DECISIONS_LOG.md`.
3. If `required`, create a ticket in `ai/project/features/_foundation/tickets/` and implement it.
4. When the ticket is merged, mark the item `done`.

**Do not start Phase 3 until every `required` item is `done`.**
